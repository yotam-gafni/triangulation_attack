Helper script for "Long-term Data Sharing under Exclusivity Attacks"

python3.7 dlr_inference.py

The script demonstrates the operation of the triangulation attack for d-LR. 
Choose a dimension using the parameter d. Choose a random seed.
The script outputs graphs for d=1,2. It also calculates the matrices
X^TX and X^Ty in two ways: One by direct calculation, and the other by
the inference method detailed in the proof of Theorem 2.
